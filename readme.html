<p>This app creates, modifies, and deletes information that it creates on the PAN Firewall.  As a result, please do not edit addresses in PAN created by Phantom.  Doing so may result in unexpected behavior when performing actions on Phantom-created addresses.</p>
<p>
  The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the Tala server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
