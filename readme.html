<p>This app creates, modifies, and deletes information that it creates on the PAN Firewall.  As a result, please do not edit addresses in PAN created by Phantom.  Doing so may result in unexpected behavior when performing actions on SOAR-created addresses.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

    From version 2.1.x onwards, the app only supports PAN Firewall version 9 and above.
</p>

<h2>Port Details</h2>
